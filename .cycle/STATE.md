# .cycle/STATE.md — In-Progress Cycle State

Tracks the *currently running* cycle so work can be resumed across sessions.
Read first by `/cycle-status` and `/cycle-resume`. When a cycle completes, its
results move to `PROJECT_HEALTH.md` + `.cycle/metrics.csv` and this file resets
to the "none in progress" state.

## Current Cycle

- **Status:** /broad-scan + /broad-implement (H1/M5/M2/M3/M1 + Tier-1 M6/M4/L2) + /sync-docs; then /targeted-audit+implement of Knowledge/RAG (A1–A4); Detection & Categorization (A1–A4); AI Insights & Audit (A1–A2) — all on branch `claude/sweet-brahmagupta-3uwc4r`; awaiting review/deploy. Tests now 760 (was 745, +15 AIA1 classification cases).

### AI Insights & Audit targeted cycle (this session)
Audited; 3 findings (1 Medium AIA1, 2 Low AIA2/AIA3). Implemented A1–A2, deferred A3:
- **A1 (AIA1)** ai-audit.js: Tier-1 dollar-claim arithmetic now SKIPS claims whose context signals a non-current-month window (annual / multi-month / YTD / projected / average — `CROSS_PERIOD_RE`), since the only per-category + subscription actuals it has are this-month. Stops false-positive CRITICAL findings (audit-alert notification spam + deflated audit_accuracy%) on annualized advice. this-month/unqualified claims still checked. Exported `CROSS_PERIOD_RE` + added 15 classification tests.
- **A2 (AIA2)** insights.js /api/insights/rebuild: moved the `entry_type='rebuild'` usage-row INSERT to immediately after the Claude call — BEFORE the tool-block validation early-returns and the summary UPDATE — so a rebuild that truncates/fails-validation (previously 500'd before the insert) still records its already-incurred spend against the shared monthly cap. Failure now logged loudly.
- **Deferred:** A3 (AIA3 — empty insight_text row reaches the feed when the model returns neither tool nor text block; cosmetic, rare with tool_choice forced).

### Seams audit (this session) — COMPLETE, clean
Audited the cross-subsystem boundaries. No Critical/High/Medium. Verified OK:
webhook event shape (in-process deliverDigestInProcess + HTTP receiver insert
identical emails columns + identical recipient resolution; status CHECK allows
draft/scheduled); perfinPool read contract (all linked_accounts/detected_subscriptions
columns rag.js + the Perfin widget assume exist today, INV-35); productivity-context
(todos/emails/notes/weekly_reviews columns exist; standalone fallback unwraps /api/review
shape); embedded-auth + pool wiring (no HTTP self-fetch except documented standalone
fallbacks + the test event, INV-25); settings↔shell idle-cache (shellAuthInvalidator
wired callback, sanitizeBoolMap + bounds, SN-5).
Findings:
- **SEAM-1 (Low, doc/impl drift — FIXED this session):** CLAUDE.md said enrollments.js/insights.js hold "inline copies" of SPLIT_AMOUNT; they actually IMPORT it from financial-queries.js and template-interpolate (safe `.replace` alias transforms), so they can't drift. Only sheets-sync.js (byte-matching) + Apps Script Code.gs (stale fork, broad-scan L1) are true copies. Corrected the Shared-Account-Spending-Split doc section.
- **SEAM-2 (Low, accepted):** cross-app perfinPool reads + the Perfin widget swallow ALL errors (→ null / connected:false), so a FUTURE Perfin column rename degrades silently. Documented INV-35 posture; intentional. No action.

### Platform, Shell & Auth targeted cycle (this session)
Audited the full subsystem (shell/index.js, auth.js, webauthn.js, server.js, startup.js, database.js, keep-alive.js, reset-fresh.js). Strong shape — 0 Critical/High/Medium, 4 Low. Implemented A1–A2, deferred A3/A4:
- **A1 (PSA1)** database.js: version-gated the detection-key orphan cleanup (bumped SCHEMA_VERSION 2→3; wrapped the two UPDATEs in `if (currentVersion < 3)`) so it runs ONCE instead of every boot — stops the recurring rare false-deactivation (two distinct merchants sharing a raw name, one renamed) and makes "one-shot" true. schema_migrations now gates one step (was observability-only).
- **A2 (PSA2)** shell/webauthn.js: pinned `requireUserVerification: true` on verifyAuthenticationResponse. NOTE: @simplewebauthn/server v11 ALREADY defaults this to true (verified in node_modules), so this is a defense-in-depth PIN against a future SDK-default flip, NOT a live-vuln fix — the audit finding overstated it.
- **Deferred:** A3 (reset-fresh CASCADE FK-topology guard — latent), A4 (shell shutdown doesn't stop sub-app cron — cosmetic).
- Tests 760, 0 fail.

### Rotation status
Cycles: Bank Sync, Financial Analytics, broad pass, Knowledge/RAG, Detection & Categorization, AI Insights & Audit + seams audit, Platform/Shell & Auth. Next rotation: Settings/Notifications/Cross-app, then Sheets, Web UI, Per-sistant Backend/Web UI.

### Doc drift to sync (NEXT /sync-docs)
- CLAUDE.md Database section says "schema_migrations ... recorded for observability only; it does not gate any migration logic today" AND the "Detection-key migration window" section says the cleanup "runs on every startup" — both now STALE after A1 (the cleanup is version-gated to run once via `currentVersion < 3`). Correct both.
- Optionally note A2's `requireUserVerification: true` pin in the WebAuthn/biometric section.

### Detection & Categorization targeted cycle (this session)
Audited; 7 findings, all Low (3 prior broad-scan items here — M1 LIKE-escaping, M2 cap-escape, L2 CSV balance match — already fixed earlier this cycle). Implemented A1–A4, deferred A5/A6:
- **A1 (DC1)** detect-subscriptions.js: `"bp "` → `"bp"` so the gas-station exclusion word-boundary-matches `BP` instead of substring-matching `"bp "` mid-word.
- **A2 (DC2)** detect-subscriptions.js: header comment "last 12 months" → "36 months" (matches the query window).
- **A3 (DC3)** categorize.js: the three IMPLICIT rule-creation paths (review, accuracy-review, from-transaction) no longer overwrite `match_type` on conflict — they reactivate the existing rule but keep its match semantics. The EXPLICIT `POST /api/categorization-rules` (where the user deliberately chooses match_type) is intentionally unchanged.
- **A4 (DC6)** subscriptions.js: split-sum validation now compares integer cents (`round(x*100)`) — honors the documented "within $0.01" exactly AND is float-safe (replaces the `> 0.011` FP padding).
- **Deferred:** A5 (DC5/DC4 — Schwab parser return NaN not 0 on no-valid-amount; needs a CapOne CSV sample to settle the both-columns-0.00 case), A6 (DC7 — stale `MODEL_MAP.opus` → claude-opus-4-6; belongs to the AI Insights model-config cycle).

### Rotation status
Cycles done: 1 Bank Sync, 2 Financial Analytics, + broad pass, + Knowledge/RAG, + Detection & Categorization. Next per rotation: AI Insights & Audit (4). Seams audit is due after this (every 3 subsystem cycles).

### Knowledge / RAG targeted cycle (this session)
Audited Knowledge/RAG; 6 findings (1 Medium, 5 Low). Implemented A1–A4, deferred A5/A6:
- **A1 (K1, Medium)** vault-sync.js syncVault prose branch: `await clearFacts(pool, path)` so a fact-file→prose conversion drops orphaned facts that were still being injected into answers (asymmetry with prose→fact, which already cleared the doc).
- **A2 (K2, Low)** rag.js upcomingFacts: `value::date` → `to_date(value,'YYYY-MM-DD')` so one date-shaped-but-invalid fact value (e.g. 2025-02-30) can't throw and silently disable ALL upcoming-fact notifications.
- **A3 (K4, Low)** vault-sync.js syncNotes: now holds the `_syncing` single-flight lock (busy→no-op) so the hourly cron's notes phase and a concurrent reindex can't overlap-embed. Strengthens INV-36 (previously the notes leg was unlocked).
- **A4 (K5, Low)** vault-sync.js embedSource: empty-body sources now upsert `embed_state` (chunk_count 0) instead of just clearSource, so the content-hash skip engages instead of re-clearing every sync.
- **Deferred:** A5 (K3 — parse inline [n] in the Citations fallback so `grounded` isn't always false on that path), A6 (K6 — allow capture into private/secret tier). Plus cross-module follow-on: verify Per-sistant's shared `renderMd` escapes raw HTML (not just link schemes) since the Knowledge answer renders via `renderMd` into innerHTML under a CSP that still has `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` (PB-3).
- **Phase:** implemented — not yet Health-Synthesized (broad-scan Axis-A scores recorded in the session report, not yet promoted to PROJECT_HEALTH.md).
- **Subsystem audited:** broad pass across all subsystems (cycle 3, broad). Prior: Bank Sync (cycle 1), Financial Analytics (cycle 2).
- **Started:** 2026-06-09
- **Findings gathered (broad scan):** H1 (High — getNetWorth dedup direction drops Plaid brokerage value), M1–M6 + ~15 Low. Top-5: H1, M5, M2, M3, M1.
- **Implementation progress (this session):** H1, M5, M2, M3, M1 committed + pushed (commit f871cef); docs synced (92c080c); then Tier-1 follow-up M6, M4, L2 implemented + tested (745 pass, 0 fail).

### Findings implemented this session
- **H1** `getNetWorth` (financial-queries.js): flipped dedup direction — drop the $0 Plaid `linked_accounts` phantom when an active `investment_accounts` row exists; `investment_accounts` is authoritative (matches /api/investments + dashboard grid). Updated the two cycle-fixes.test.js getNetWorth mocks (they routed on a bare `/investment_accounts/` substring that now also matches the linked query's NOT EXISTS subquery — routed on `FROM linked_accounts` instead).
- **M5** budget-snapshot auto-trigger (startup.js): removed the `getDate()===1` gate so a missed prior-month snapshot is caught up on any later tick (idempotent via the existing-snapshot short-circuit). Fixes silent rollover loss on free-tier sleep.
- **M2** categorize AI loop (categorize.js): a swallowed usage-row INSERT no longer lets spend escape the cap — on insert failure we apply the already-paid batch, then stop the loop (`budgetHit=true`).
- **M3** sheets buildDashboard (sheets-sync.js): budget-join category expression now matches the SPENDING BY CATEGORY query (adds `personal_finance_category->>'primary'`), so the budget tab's "Spent" agrees with the breakdown on the same sheet.
- **M1** categorization-rule LIKE (categorize.js, both runCategorize + /apply): escape `\ % _` in user patterns with `REPLACE(...) ESCAPE '\'` so a `%`/`_` in a pattern can't act as a wildcard. exact (`=`) unchanged.

### Tier 1 follow-up implemented (this session, after the H1/M5/M2/M3/M1 batch)
- **M6** shell/index.js: added a `verify` hook to the shell's `express.json` so `req.rawBody` is captured under the unified shell — the embedded Per-sistant webhook receiver now HMAC-verifies the exact signed bytes instead of falling back to re-stringifying `req.body`.
- **M4** scripts/sheets-sync.js: `buildDashboard` now routes the three per-category queries (categorySummary, categoryByMonth, budgetData) through a splits-aware `cat_lines` CTE (parent_no_splits ∪ from_splits) mirroring getCategorySpendingForMonth, so per-category Sheets totals match the app for users who split transactions. Total queries (monthlySummary, totals) + topMerchants intentionally left parent-keyed.
- **L2** teller/routes/subscriptions.js: CSV-import balance auto-update now matches the user's manual account by EXACT institution name OR EXACT account label (was a `name LIKE '%institution%'` substring that could overwrite the wrong account).

### Still deferred (in broad-scan report)
- L1 (Apps Script Code.gs stale fork), L3 (split tolerance 0.011), L4 (detection-key cleanup runs every boot / "one-shot" comment), L5 ($0 CSV skip), L6 (ephemeral SESSION_SECRET, embedded-irrelevant), L7 (syncNotes outside _syncing lock), L8 (empty-doc embed_state), L9 (return_to on requireAuth redirect). Plus Tier-3 effectiveness/completeness items.

### Next concrete step
- Review + deploy (Render auto-deploys on merge to `main`). Then `/sync-docs` to fix CLAUDE.md's getNetWorth Key Design Decision (it documents the OLD/wrong dedup direction). Optionally `/reflect` to record broad-scan metrics + a candidate invariant for the net-worth dedup direction.

### Decisions made this cycle (cycle 2 — Financial Analytics)
- **A1/F1** liability set = `type IN ('credit','loan')` (Plaid's two debt types cover all loan subtypes); return shape of `getNetWorth` unchanged so its 3 snapshot writers + dashboard + context-export need no caller changes.
- **A2/F2** extracted `deriveGoalProgress()` shared by GET /api/goals + context-export to kill the parallel-source-of-truth drift (was an inline duplicate).
- **A4/F4** trend scoped to the latest entry's score_type; added `score_type` to the trend object (additive).

### Decisions made cycle 1 (Bank Sync & Ingestion)

### Decisions made this cycle
- **BS-1** judged advisable despite Teller's default `count` being undocumented:
  the fix is page-size-independent (paginate until empty page / floor), so it is
  correct under any default. Sets `count=500` (documented Teller param) to bound
  round-trips; MAX_PAGES=100 runaway guard.
- **BS-2** Schwab Amount-column sign assumed negative=debit (parity with the
  Chase format + this format's Withdrawal→positive mapping). One-line flip if a
  real Schwab Amount export proves the opposite convention.
- **BS-4** Plaid cursor (INV-04) + xmax counting (INV-01) pinned via
  source-pinned tests rather than live-client behavioral tests
  (`syncPlaidItemTransactions` is not exported; behavioral would need a
  module-surface change out of scope).

### Residual / follow-on
- BS-1 MAX_PAGES break advances the watermark even if a >50k-txn account wasn't
  fully paged (warns to console). Beyond single-operator scale; revisit only if
  the warn ever fires.
- BS-1 depends on Teller accepting `count=500` (documented param; standard
  clamp expected). Watch the first post-deploy Teller sync.

## Where I left off
Cycle 2 (Financial Analytics) A1–A5 implemented on `claude/pensive-davinci-JhKFb`;
tests green at 666. Cycle 1 (Bank Sync, BS-1..BS-8) is in open PR #108. No cycle
work outstanding — next is `/reflect` (promote INV-27, record cycle-2 metrics)
then rotate to Detection & Categorization.
